# üó∫Ô∏è Namespace

Namespaces in C++ serve several important purposes:

1. Avoid naming conflicts: Namespaces help prevent naming collisions between different parts of code. This is especially useful in large projects or when using multiple libraries.
2. Organize code: They allow you to group related functionality together, improving code organization and readability.
3. Create modular code: Namespaces support better encapsulation and modularity by separating different components of a program.
4. Control scope: They provide a way to control the scope of names, allowing you to have multiple entities with the same name in different namespaces.
5. Support for large-scale development: Namespaces facilitate collaborative development by allowing different teams to work on separate parts of a project without worrying about name conflicts.
6. Versioning: They can be used to manage different versions of code or APIs within the same program.
7. Improve code clarity: By using namespaces, you can make it clear where certain functions or classes come from, improving code readability.

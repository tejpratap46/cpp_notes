# üç° Vector \[ArrayList]

**What is a Vector?**

A vector in C++ is a sequence container that represents a dynamic array. This means it's similar to a regular array but with the added flexibility of automatically resizing itself as needed. It's part of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).

**Key Characteristics:**

* **Dynamic Size:** Vectors can grow or shrink as elements are added or removed.
* **Contiguous Storage:** Elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, allowing efficient random access.
* **Efficient Random Access:** Elements can be accessed directly using their index, similar to arrays.
* **Iterators:** You can use iterators to traverse elements.
* **Automatic Memory Management:** Handles memory allocation and deallocation internally.

Conceptually, we can create a dynamic arraylist:

# Move Constructor

Move semantics is an important feature introduced in C++11 that helps improve performance by reducing unnecessary copying of objects. Here's a concise explanation of move semantics:

1. Basic concept: Move semantics allows transferring resources from one object to another instead of copying them.
2. Key components:
   1. Rvalue references (&&)
   2. Move constructors
   3. Move assignment operators
3. Main benefits:
   1. Improved performance for operations involving temporary objects
   2. More efficient resource management
4. How it works: When an object is about to be destroyed (like a temporary), its resources can be "moved" to another object instead of being copied and then destroyed.
